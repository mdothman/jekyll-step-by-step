# __Jekyll-Step-By_Step__

## User Story
  * __AS A WEB DEVELOPER__ in order to be able to retain the information I absorb I must understand basic fundamentals of Jekyll.
  * Repetetion and semantics are proven to be helpful with memory recollection.
  * By using the direct documentation, I hope to retain Jekyll by using it for something
## Process
  * Using [Jekyll Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) I will absorb basic fundamentals of the gem.
  * I will be keeping hand written notes that I will later transfer to a [Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EjzloktB1ZBnxl4wznVx-NTRYF0zrdqZdlsj0D-82Pw/edit?usp=sharing)
  * Occasionally I will challenge my knowledge and take breaks.
## Aspirations
  1. Learning how to use Jekyll
  2. Understanding Ruby and Ruby Gems
  3. Gaining skills in web development
